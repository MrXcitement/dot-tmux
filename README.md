# TMUX Configuration

## My personalized tmux configuration

I use tmux to run long running process in the background so that I can detatch
and come back to them some point in the future. This can be used when
installing software packages or building applications.  

More tmux information can be found here: https://tmux.github.io

## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/mrxcitement/dot-tmux
    $ ./install
